# SDL Event Management System: System Analysis

## Research Methodology

The development of the SDL Event Management System began with a comprehensive analysis of the existing event management landscape and stakeholder needs. Our research methodology included:

1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Conducted interviews with students, event organizers, and administrative staff to understand pain points and requirements.

2. **Existing Systems Analysis**: Evaluated current event management solutions to identify strengths and weaknesses.

3. **Literature Review**: Researched best practices in web-based event management and user engagement.

4. **Competitive Analysis**: Compared features of existing event management platforms to identify opportunities for innovation.

## Related Work and Existing Solutions

### Generic Event Management Platforms

Platforms like Eventbrite, Meetup, and Evite offer general event management capabilities:

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive event creation tools
- Registration and ticketing functionality
- Mobile applications and notifications
- Social sharing capabilities

**Limitations:**

- Not tailored to educational context
- Lack of integration with academic interests and curriculum
- Often include fees or commissions on tickets
- Limited customization for academic institution needs
- No personalization based on academic profiles

### Institution-Specific Calendar Systems

Many academic institutions utilize basic calendar systems or portal announcements:

**Strengths:**

- Integrated with institutional authentication
- Official source of information
- Familiar to campus community

**Limitations:**

- Limited interactivity (one-way communication)
- Basic or non-existent registration capabilities
- Poor personalization features
- Typically lack recommendation systems
- Minimal analytics for organizers
- Often have outdated user interfaces

### Manual Processes

Traditional approaches using email lists, spreadsheets, and paper forms:

**Strengths:**

- Low technical barrier to implementation
- Flexible and adaptable to different event types
- No dependency on system availability

**Limitations:**

- Highly time-consuming for organizers
- Prone to human error
- Difficult to scale for larger events
- Limited data consistency and integrity
- No centralized record-keeping
- Poor user experience for students

## Limitations of Existing Systems

### Discoverability Issues

Existing solutions generally fail to connect the right events with interested students:

- Information is scattered across multiple platforms
- Limited search and filtering capabilities
- No personalization based on student interests
- Poor notification systems for relevant new events
- Difficulty distinguishing between academic and social events

### User Experience Challenges

Current approaches often create friction in the user journey:

- Multiple steps required to register for events
- Inconsistent interfaces across different event types
- Limited mobile optimization
- Poor accessibility features
- Lack of consistent event information format

### Administrative Inefficiencies

Organizers face numerous challenges with existing tools:

- Duplicate data entry across systems
- Manual tracking of registrations and attendance
- Difficulty communicating with registered participants
- Limited ability to analyze participation patterns
- Cumbersome event editing and update processes

### Technical Limitations

Current systems often have technical constraints:

- Limited integration with institutional data
- Poor scalability during peak registration periods
- Inadequate security for personal information
- Limited customization options
- Minimal or non-existent APIs for extension
